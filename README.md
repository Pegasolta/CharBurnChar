## Synopsis

This game was created during my WDI course with General Assembly. It is a classic plane shooting game repackaged with the theme of Pokemon. The game is written in Javascript, HTML and CSS. 

## Instructions

Using their cursor, players will need to weave in and out of enemy Pokemons while shooting them down. As the game progresses, the difficulty increases as the spawn rate of enemies becomes more rapid. Attacks are fired automatically. 

More information can be found at the “HOW TO PLAY” section of the game itself.
